# ConnectionProvider

## What is ConnectionProvider?
ConnectionProvider is a React context provider. It allows your application to connect to a specific Solana network endpoint (such as the mainnet, devnet, or testnet). Once connected, it shares this connection with all its child components, enabling them to interact with the blockchain seamlessly.

### Props:
###  endpoint (string):
- This is the URL of the Solana network you want your app to connect to. Common options include:

  - Mainnet: https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com (for live production environments).
  - Devnet: https://api.devnet.solana.com (for testing purposes).
  - Testnet: https://api.testnet.solana.com (for pre-production testing).
  - Localnet: http://127.0.0.1:8899 (for local development).

By specifying this endpoint, you tell your app which blockchain instance to use.

### children (ReactNode): 
- This refers to the components of your application that require access to the Solana connection. These components are placed inside the ConnectionProvider, and they inherit the connection context.

### **Example in layout.tsx:**
```tsx
import {  ReactNode } from "react";
import { ConnectionProvider } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <ConnectionProvider endpoint="https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com">
      {children}
    </ConnectionProvider>
  );
}
```
